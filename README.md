# Triangle-Project-
The triangle program accepts three integers, a, b, and c, as input.
hese are taken to be sides of a triangle. The output of the program is the type of triangle determined by the three sides: Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, or NotATriangle.

The integers a, b, and c must satisfy the following conditions:
c1. 1 ≤ a ≤ 200
c4. a < b + c
c2. 1 ≤ b ≤ 200
c5. b < a + c
c3. 1 ≤ c ≤ 200
c6. c < a + b
If an input value fails any of conditions c1, c2, or c3, the program notes this with an output message, for example, “Value of b is not in the range of permitted values.” If values of a, b, and c satisfy conditions c4, c5, and c6, one of four mutually exclusive outputs is given:
1. If all three sides are equal, the program output is Equilateral.

2. If exactly one pair of sides is equal, the program output is Isosceles.

3. If no pair of sides is equal, the program output is Scalene.

4. If any of conditions c4, c5, and c6 is not met, the program output is NotATriangle.

There were 10 different 10 different testing stragegies such as A/B testing, UI testing, Junit and etc.
